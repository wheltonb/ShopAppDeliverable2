Site explanation for ease of use;<br>
Please before running app use the init_db and inject_sample_data modules as you cannot create an administrator account without being an existing admin or hard-coding one in.

API link is on Homepage in navbar, I used the standard cat-fact API purely because it is painful to type for periods of time so I am severly behind submission as well as do not have much capacity for excess volumes of experimentation on more function-based API implementation.

Also included in navbar is the filter based on product type.
